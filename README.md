# **Marvin's Number Game**

###Gameplay
Marvin's Number Game revolves around the user pressing one of four pearls with different values, all randomized. The player has to continually select a pearl in order to match the target total. If the target total is exceeded, then the player loses and the game restarts with another set of randomized values.

In order to achieve this jQuery was used for the game's logic (including the randomization feature).
